Customer Insights View: gold.report_customers
===============================================================================
Purpose:
    - To create a reusable view that summarizes customer behavior and value.
    - Enable segmentation, recency tracking, and lifecycle analysis.

Key Metrics Generated:
    - Total Orders, Sales, Quantity, Unique Products
    - Lifespan (Months Active) and Last Order Date
    - Recency (Months Since Last Purchase)
    - Age and Age Group Classification
    - Customer Segments: VIP, Regular, New
    - Average Order Value (AOV)
    - Average Monthly Spend

SQL Concepts Used:
    - View Creation with DROP IF EXISTS
    - CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
    - Aggregate Functions: SUM(), COUNT(), MAX(), MIN()
    - Date Functions: DATEDIFF(), GETDATE()
    - CASE Statements for Segmentation
    - Basic Error Handling (division by zero)

Output:
    - A persistent view named `gold.report_customers` for BI reporting
